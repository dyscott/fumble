# Fumble

## Inspiration

As CS students move up in their classes, group projects and assignemnts become more and more common and complex. However, despite the numerous group projects/assignments that one does throughout their educational career, a recurring challenge that we face is finding reliable teammates you can collaborate and connect with. Enter Fumble, our solution designed to simplify the process of finding project collaborators. More than just a matching platform, Fumble stands as an initial touchpoint, facilitating meaningful connections by not only showcasing fellow class members actively seeking teammates but also providing a seamless messaging feature to foster communication among matched users. With Fumble, the journey from solo struggles to collaborative triumphs becomes a shared adventure, transforming the educational experience for CS students.
